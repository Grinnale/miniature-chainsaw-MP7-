This mini-project creates a banking system that stores transactions between Alexis and Blake. Our Block class mines and creates blocks, which hold important data such as our hash and the amount transferred. Hash creates a Hash object with a byte array as its field. BlockChain creates a linked list of nodes, and the nodes each store a Block. The BlockChain is also how we alter our linked list. The BlockChainDriver gives the user an interface to run the BlockChain methods, and it prints the toString of the BlockChain.
